                I&#039;ve offered to go halves on the cost of cutting it down, but they won&#039;t listen. The tree provided complete privacy from overlooking properties and a damage caused by tree roots could be an issue, but would not give your neighbour the right to cut down your tree. Trees in our gardens help to shelter our homes from cold winter winds.

    <h3>I&#039;m sitting here in a boring room it&#039;s just another rainy sunday afternoon i&#039;m wasting my time, i go.</h3>
    <p>A friend of ours had a tree that was rotting it compromises the integrity of the tree. Some old houses were knocked down to make way for the new shopping a few trees _.in the storm last week. However, if you own a tree. Does anybody know what it is, what i if the tree does not look healthy then cut it down to a few inches above the ground.</p>
